#Iterative Project
To access this project, Visual Studio 2022 is required, and it must be configured with ASP.NET and web development components.

This represents my second project, characterized by a structured iterative approach spanning a week with five distinct iterations. The development team, consisting of four members, including myself, utilized C# and ASP.NET within the Visual Studio 2022 environment.

The primary objective of the project was to establish a functionality that calls a website, retrieves business IDs and company names, and subsequently displays this information on a dedicated web page. Notably, this project was undertaken for another group within our class.
